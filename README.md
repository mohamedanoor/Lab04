Liban: 
Subtask 1: Create the class BTPrinting that extends BinaryTree class. Inside this class, implement
two recursive methods:
1. public void postOrder(): this method prints the BinaryTree with Post-Order traverse
2. public void printRight(): this method prints nodes on the rightmost (most right-hand
side) path of a binary tree, starting from the lowest level all the way to the root.
Override the testing method, provide a sample tree, and call the two methods above in this
method

Julian:
Subtask 2: Create class searchBT that extends BrinaryTree class. Inside this class, implement two
recursive methods:
1. public boolean containsGreater(int item): returns true if there is an item greater than
the input in the tree, otherwise false
2. public int getLevel(int item): returns the level of the item in the tree, -1 if not found
Override the testing method, provide a sample tree, and call the two methods above in this
method and print the output.

Ashley:
Subtask 3: Create class aggregateBT that extends BrinaryTree class. Inside this class, implement
two recursive methods:
1. public int countEvenNumber(): returns the number of nodes with even values
2. public int findSum(): returns the summation of values in the tree
Override the testing method, provide a sample tree, and call the two methods above in this
method and print the output.
